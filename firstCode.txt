Java is a widely-used programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle)
in the mid-1990s. It is known for its simplicity, platform independence, and robustness. Java is an 
object-oriented language, which means it focuses on creating reusable code components called objects. 
It also features automatic memory management through garbage collection, making it easier for developers 
to write and maintain their code.
