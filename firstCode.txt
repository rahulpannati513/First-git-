Java is a widely-used programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle)
in the mid-1990s. It is known for its simplicity, platform independence, and robustness. Java is an 
object-oriented language, which means it focuses on creating reusable code components called objects. 
It also features automatic memory management through garbage collection, making it easier for developers 
to write and maintain their code. Java has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, making it suitable
for a wide range of applications, from desktop software to web development and mobile app development. 
It is also the language of choice for building enterprise-level applications. Overall, Java's versatility
and widespread adoption have made it one of the most popular programming languages in the world.
